## Customization

ModernClocks is fully customizable. You can easily adjust the clock's appearance, font, size, and blur effect to fit your preferences. Here's how you can modify the skin:

### Change Clock Position

To change the position of the clock on your screen:

1. Open the `ModernClocks.ini` file in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text).
2. Look for the `[Variables]` section, where you’ll see variables for `ClockX` and `ClockY`.
3. Adjust these values to move the clock around your screen. For example, setting `ClockX=200` will move the clock 200 pixels to the right.

```ini
[Variables]
ClockX=200
ClockY=150
```

### Adjust Font and Size

ModernClocks allows you to easily modify the font and size of the displayed time and date.

1. In the `[MeterTime]` and `[MeterDate]` sections of the `.ini` file, find the `FontFace` and `FontSize` settings.
2. Change `FontFace` to any font installed on your system (e.g., `Arial`, `Helvetica`, etc.).
3. Modify `FontSize` to increase or decrease the size of the clock.

```ini
FontFace=Segoe UI
FontSize=64
```

### Change the Blur Effect

You can control the strength of the blur effect on the background.

1. In the `[MeterBackground]` section, find the `EffectStrength` variable.
2. Adjust the value to increase or decrease the blur strength. A higher value will result in a more pronounced blur.

```ini
EffectStrength=30
```

### Date and Time Format

By default, ModernClocks displays the time in a 24-hour format (`%H:%M:%S`). If you prefer a 12-hour format with AM/PM, you can change this in the `[MeasureTime]` section.

1. Open the `ModernClocks.ini` file.
2. In the `[MeasureTime]` section, change the `Format` variable to `%I:%M:%S %p` for a 12-hour format.

```ini
[MeasureTime]
Measure=Time
Format=%I:%M:%S %p
```

This will display the time like `02:30:45 PM`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the ModernClocks skin, here are some common solutions:

### Clock Not Displaying Correctly

- Ensure that the skin is activated in Rainmeter.
- Double-check that the path to the `ModernClocks.ini` file is correct (`Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ModernClocks\ModernClocks.ini`).
- Make sure Rainmeter is updated to the latest version.

### Blur Effect Not Working

- Rainmeter’s blur effect may not work properly on older or low-end systems. If the blur doesn’t appear, try lowering the `EffectStrength` or testing with a different background image.
- Ensure your system supports transparency and blur effects.

### Font Not Changing

- Make sure the font you’re trying to use is installed on your system. If the font is not installed, Rainmeter will default to a standard font.

### Performance Issues

- If you experience performance issues or lag, reduce the size of the clock by lowering the `FontSize` or decreasing the `EffectStrength` of the blur.
- Reducing the update frequency in the `[Rainmeter]` section from `Update=1000` (1 second) to a higher number (e.g., `Update=2000` for 2 seconds) may also help reduce CPU usage.
